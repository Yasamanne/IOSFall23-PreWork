## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- App: google translate
  1) transform photos into text
  2) is very fast and has audio
  3) fast in-time translation from audio and showing the text
 
- App: Telegram
  1) transfer from one phone line to a new one is easy
  2) all the data in backup to the cloud automatically
  3) easy to have channels with different access/ comment limitation
  4) change theme capability
  5) polls/retract votes
  6) search in texts/groups

- App: CamScanner
  1) documents quality is good
  2) easy to work with converting scanned files into pdf
  3) easy to scan in batch or single

- App: Linkedin
  1) easy to work with/connect/message,...
  2) create meetings/calls
  3) easy and fast search with filter
 
- App Idea:
  An app to help with travel.
  Based on the user’s interest, distance from home, way of travel, duration, budget,... plan travel, and recommend trip plans, the user is able to filter based on location,... but if there are no filters app must recommend travel plans based on users’ interest,... or similar user 
  interests. 
  Everyone can make use of this app.
  It would be so great because I love travels. Sometimes I am not sure which place is the best. All the info is there on the Internet but must gather it from different resources. This app also can have features like finding people to travel with. Or offer cost-effective plans.
